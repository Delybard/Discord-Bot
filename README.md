# Discord-Bot
Will be the swaggiest bot you've ever seen

In order to get this Bot running you need Eris (https://abal.moe/Eris/) and Node.js
Just create a bot on discord (https://discordapp.com/login?redirect_to=/developers/applications/me), 
get it's token and enter it instead of BOT_TOKEN and the bot'll work.

Commands are pretty straight forward right now, you can check them with !help or !halp
